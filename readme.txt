Easily import listings from any XML or CSV file to Inventor WP with the Inventor WP Add-On for WP All Import.

== Description ==

The Inventor WP Add-On for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import") makes it easy to bulk import your listings to the Inventor WP plugin and Superlist theme in less than 10 minutes.

The left side shows all of the fields that you can import to and the right side displays a property listing from your XML/CSV file. Then you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the Inventor WP fields to import it.

The importer is so intuitive it is almost like manually adding a listing in Inventor WP.

= Why you should use the Inventor WP Add-On for WP All Import =

* Instead of using the Custom Fields section of WP All Import, you are shown the fields such as contact fields, social network fields, and listing categories.

* Easily import into banner images, banner videos, gallery and repeater fields like FAQ and Menu.

* Supports files in any format and structure. There are no requirements that the data in your file be organized in a certain way. CSV imports into Inventor WP are easy no matter the structure of your file.

* Supports files of practically unlimited size by automatically splitting them into chunks. WP All Import is limited solely by your server settings.
